This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in VBScript related to the `IsEmpty` function and how it interacts with variant data types. The `bug.vbs` file shows a function that incorrectly uses `IsEmpty` to check for missing parameters.  The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a corrected version that handles empty string or null values more appropriately. The issue stems from the fact that `IsEmpty` returns `true` for empty strings, which might be unexpected in some scenarios where an explicit check for an empty string is required. The solution clarifies and differentiates the checking for empty strings against the checking of whether the parameter was even passed to the function.
